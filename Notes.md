# BattleSips Notes
*For quicker startup and a central place for "planning"*

The notes will be divided into 3 sections:
- Implementation notes
- Planning
- General

## Implementation
- Having problem compiling with "Serial" from other filetypes than ".ino"
- Main: Starting from Neonodes "Simple" sketch.

## Planning
- [ ] test and verify button library
- [ ] Include button library

### Matrix Library
- Create Library

### Initial sketch
- [ ] Make it fun to start up board.
- [x] Start from scratch with a simple and maintainable base: building from a Neopixel sample (since that is the main thing on the board.)

## General notes
### 22/8/2024
Starting these notes as jumping into programming today it was quite hard to know what is the next step. Hoping this document will ease with both implementation notes on what is being designed, and also gather tought on what is needed in teh future.

Found out that Arduino for VS Code i "deprecated", and that they are pointign to the new 2.3.2 version of the Arduino IDE to be used instead. Thus my thought of keeping everyting within VS Code is probably faulty. Instead VS Code should be used for...  you guessed it, code!
